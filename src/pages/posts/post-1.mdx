<p>Hello there</p>

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website. I think I am havin rouble working with this markdown thingy. It is a pain to style, and don't get me started on the frontmatter. uuuuuuuuuugh.

<h2 style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-top: 12px;">What I have accomplished</h2>

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

<h2 style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-top: 12px;">What's next</h2>

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

```javascript

let frontmatter = "a major pain in my freaking neck!"
